- 👋 Hi, I’m @geneseeborges
- 👀 I’m interested in creative narrative reports utilizing python and GPT that will describe a set of data inputs. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to call on GPT-3.5 within a Python script. Actually, I'm learning it all for the first time. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on writing a script to generate narrative reports that describe a specific property asset. The draft report will be formatted and ready for an investment analyst to continue thinking through the conclusions (e.g., feasibility analysis, highest and best use analysis, valuation).
- 📫 How to reach me: via GitHub or LinkedIn.
